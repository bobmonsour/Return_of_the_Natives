This is the code that resulted from creating a website using Apple's iWeb app way back in 2009. The site chronicles our return to California after living in Princeton, NJ for nearly 9 years. The site had been hosted on a shared server at Dreamhost. I downloaded all the files, made a tweak so that the index.html would load the site properly and pushed the files directly to Netlify...and it worked! In other words, there is no build process involved. This is your basic web relic. The code is rather insane and uses an incredible amount of inline styling with px as the measure. You can find the site at [Return of the Natives](https://returnofthenatives.netlify.app/). And if you happen to read [one of my blog posts on the site](https://returnofthenatives.netlify.app/bobs_blog/entries/2009/6/17), you see that the image that I use in most of my social media is based on a picture from way back then.

Sadly, the blog posts seem to have an issue that obscures the text. I'll see if I can fix that...maybe.
