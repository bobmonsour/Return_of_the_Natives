    <richText>&lt;b&gt;We crossed the border into California at 12:44 this afternoon, not that I&#x2019;m counting. As we approached the border crossing between Nevada and California, I could make out the imposing gate-like structure, complete with uniformed guards, offices and vehicle inspection area. None of those insignificant signs &#x201C;Welcome to Pennsylvania&#x201D; or &#x201C;You are entering Nevada&#x201D; for the Golden Nation, ah, State.&#xD;&#xD;I stopped for the guard to question me as to whether or not I had any produce stashed somewhere in my car. No, sir, no produce. Strangely, he also asked if my dogs were the only animals I was bringing into California. Heck, fella. My dogs weigh in at 125 and 60 pounds respectively. So where do you think I could hide that iguana, monkey or boa constrictor -- in my station wagon? No, the dogs are the only animals. Bright smile. I have to say I nearly teared up as I sailed past the check point and back home at last!&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
