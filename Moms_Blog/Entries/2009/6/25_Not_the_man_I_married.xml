    <richText>&lt;b&gt;To say that Bob was not an animal lover when I married him is a gross understatement of the situation. His family had never kept pets when he was growing up, consequently he interacted with my pets very carefully, as though they were life forms from another planet. Of course, they knew it. &#xD;&#xD;Turn the page. Bob now actually pets the dogs, gives them cookies and accompanies us on walkies. But last night he became a new man, see photo above. I was completely speechless but very satisfied with the new blush of puppy love.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
