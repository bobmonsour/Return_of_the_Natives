    <richText>&lt;b&gt;This morning is overcast and chilly. It rained last night, the ground is spongy, saturated with water. The weather suits our collective mood. Just as we&#x2019;re not certain if there will be another electrical storm or bright sunshine within the hour, our excitement about the move is clouded with anxiety over the big unknowns: the drive across the county, our new lives out west.&#xD;&#xD;A pause for wry amusement: Willie has learned to pose for photographs. With the camera held in shooting position, I call his name. Willie looks at me and freezes until he hears the click of the shutter. Most of the time he waits to hear &#x201C;good dog&#x201D; before he moves from his spot. Gotta love him.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
