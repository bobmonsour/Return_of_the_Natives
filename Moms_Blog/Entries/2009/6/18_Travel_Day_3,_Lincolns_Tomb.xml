    <richText>&lt;b&gt;&#x201C;Now he belongs to the ages.&#x201D; &#xD;&#xD;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;With Bob in the lead, our little caravan cris-crossed through residential streets of Springfield to Oak Ridge Cemetery where Abraham Lincoln is buried.&#xD; &#xD;The grey stone and marble mausoleum sits on a little rise, and is quickly revealed as you make your way up the entrance road of the cemetery. It is very prominent, but still dignified.&#xD;&#xD;The interior of the mausoleum is finished in earth-colored marble of varying hues; tans, browns, earth reds. A simple  corridor leads to the rear of the mausoleum. Several small bronze statues of Lincoln, each marking a different point in the great man&#x2019;s life and career, are carefully placed at turns in the corridor. The interior environment is dignified and understated, perhaps that made the revelation of Lincoln&#x2019;s simple tomb even more moving.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
