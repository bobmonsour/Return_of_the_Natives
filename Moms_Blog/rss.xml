Was this just another over-night stop? Whenever I would get my car keys and head for the Volvo, Willie and Magic would start to jump and collide nervously. You’re not leaving us behind, are you? @#@^??&gt;(*&amp;amp;!!! (That’s dog swearing.) After a couple of days here they are beginning to relax.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our first task upon arrival was to head to Pier One and purchase chairs. Now we all have a place to sit. Luxury! The kitchen has a small built-in desk which we all use in turn for computer work. Since all the appliances, including washer and dryer, are built-in we have all the conveniences. While sleeping on the wood floor in sleeping bags isn’t deluxe, it has made for some great jokes and some memorable moments. Movers arrive on Wednesday.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Today Comcast arrived and hooked up our internet and television services. We are all very happy about this. Bob gets to watch Wimbledon and catch up on correspondence on his laptop instead of his phone. Dan found his way back into iTunes immediately, and I set out to finish up the trip blog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dan is restless. He makes lots of calls to kids in NJ and spends lots of time on iChat. He’s feeling disjointed and probably a bit depressed, but once we become involved in neighborhood or school activities, his malaise will pass. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This morning, with surprising willingness, Dan began reading one of the two novels he must have finished by the time school begins on August 18. Steinbeck’s Travels with Charlie, could not be more appropriate for a young man who just completed a cross-country trip in the company of two dogs. Willie even resembles a Standard Poodle!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The pool has been grand fun. Every afternoon so far we’ve headed for the pool. Our great entertainment is trying to coax Willie and Magic into the pool. Magic has gone in as far as her belly, then beat a hasty retreat. Willie has dipped one paw with great trepidation, then joined Magic in the shade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We’re grateful to friends and family who have been sending encouraging messages. Thank you!! Dan is thrilled whenever he hears from a pal from New Jersey. Please continue to keep him company!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We wish you all a wonderful summer, with luck you will also enjoy at least one terrific adventure. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take good care and keep in touch.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sandra&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

In spite of accumulated fatigue, we couldn’t get on the road early enough. We were so ready for the drive to be behind us but we were also very anxious to reach our destination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After descending into the valley from gorgeous Lake Tahoe, we entered the Sacramento metropolitan area, but did not even consider stopping to see the capitol building. It was hot and sunny, we were thirsty, but we didn’t stop. We were on a mission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We did make a brief pit stop at UC Davis, at the recently opened Robert Mondavi Institute for Wine and Food Sciences complex to be exact. The facilities are beautifully designed, absolutely gorgeous. Of course, there’s a small vineyard on the adjoining parcel of land. The place looks as though -- if you were a grad student in the food sciences -- you’d give your eye teeth to study there.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After Davis, we made a B-Line for Point B. We continued on the I-80, then turned north to catch the 101 through Vallejo and Novato. That way, we were able to approach San Rafael by way of the wetlands, which I find uncommonly beautiful. We also passed Frank lloyd Wright’s Marin County Courthouse.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Just about noon on Friday long road trip home finally ended. We were totally exhausted but super-excited, and happy to arrive safely. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

His family had never kept pets when he was growing up, consequently he interacted with my pets very carefully, as though they were life forms from another planet. Of course, they knew it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Turn the page. Bob now actually pets the dogs, gives them cookies and accompanies us on walkies. But last night he became a new man, see photo above. I was completely speechless but very satisfied with the new blush of puppy love.</description>

As we approached the border crossing between Nevada and California, I could make out the imposing gate-like structure, complete with uniformed guards, offices and vehicle inspection area. None of those insignificant signs “Welcome to Pennsylvania” or “You are entering Nevada” for the Golden Nation, ah, State.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I stopped for the guard to question me as to whether or not I had any produce stashed somewhere in my car. No, sir, no produce. Strangely, he also asked if my dogs were the only animals I was bringing into California. Heck, fella. My dogs weigh in at 125 and 60 pounds respectively. So where do you think I could hide that iguana, monkey or boa constrictor -- in my station wagon? No, the dogs are the only animals. Bright smile. I have to say I nearly teared up as I sailed past the check point and back home at last!</description>

I love the subtle colors of the high prairie scrub brush, the lonesome gnarled trees, powdery dry creek beds, such a big open sky, then in the distance those purple blue mountains. I get a grin on my face and tears in my eyes. Can’t help it, there’s just something about the spare beauty of the west that makes me crazy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back to the trip. Our Days Inn room in Rock Springs had been stuffy, what with three weary travelers and two hot dogs holed up in a room with no window and an ancient window cooler. None of us really rested all that well. We were up and out to get breakfast a little earlier than usual because of it. It was wonderful to take in some early sunshine and the cool dry chill of the morning on the brief walk to eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We pulled out of our hotel around 8:20. We took the drive easy, as in the back of my mind at least, was the “check engine” dash warning, and we needed to cross more or less 150 miles of dry country with minimal services before we reached Salt Lake City and the nearest Volvo repair shop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our drive was lovely, clear hard light grazing the landscape, throwing even tiny cracks and bumps into high relief. From behind my steering wheel, the soil seemed by turns chalky, beige, caramel or dusty red. For a short spell some green earth, in fuzzy striations, appeared on the south side of the highway. In a few miles it disappeared, although I continued to look for related traces of green, or a road sign announcing which mineral had so painted the hot landscape. Didn’t see either. For me not knowing precisely what or why only enhances the landscape, as the unanswered questions increase the sense of wonder and mystery. Not having the answers, or not even knowing which questions to ask, can push an experience from the mind to the heart. That’s where I think this landscape belongs -- in the heart. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Later in the morning the sky turned a hot, intense blue. At the highway’s vanishing point a cluster of strange silvery shapes appeared. Oz? A kingdom of crystal skyscrapers? These were not mountains, they looked more like the sails of a mammoth schooner. After what seemed like an eternity of guessing, the meaning of the strange forms became apparent. Wind turbines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They had been painted white, but in the crisp air and brilliant sunshine they reflected both the sky and the surrounding land. Because the massive blades twirled the reflected colors switched in rapid fire. My eyes and brain can’t process the color shift fast enough; the color switches and after-imaging were interpreted as silver. Very cool.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Details on our car repair hiatus in Salt Lake City. The “check engine” was a warning that my car wasn’t firing all cylinders. (Put aside childish jokes for the moment, please.) Bob became worried about his brakes and had them repaired. Anyway, these mechanical problems  devoured several hours of the afternoon. After my car was repaired, I took the dogs on a motor tour of Salt Lake City. We drove up to Capitol Hill, Temple Square, Salt Palace. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Back on the highway. As you drive along I-80 west with Salt Lake City at your back, you almost immediately come upon the huge lake for which the city is named. White crystalline mounds and powdery drifts strewn about the shore and the shallows remind you that this water really is saturated with minerals; salt lake is not some fanciful misnomer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

We put Grand Island behind us quickly. The landscape opened up to corn fields, pastures and big, big skies. Collections of farm buildings surrounded by stands of sheltering trees indicated the location of homestead after homestead. From time to time I could see abandoned buildings, old barns mostly. Dotting the landscape were ponds and small creeks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As we sped along I-80, I spotted a sign for “Original Pony Express Station”, called Bob and we pulled off the highway to have a look.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</description>

We were both impressed and surprised. The building is absolutely gorgeous. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;According to the gentleman in the information office, it was built and decorated primarily by talented Nebraskans. The building was embellished with murals, marble intarsia, wrought iron work, cast iron work, bronze busts and more. Perhaps the location, in the middle of farm country, makes this showpiece even more remarkable.</description>

I wouldn’t hear of moving on without at least gawking at the Mississippi, so this morning we drove the three or so miles back into town.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hannibal is a little place, with an old-fashioned main street. There are numerous shop signs displaying the name “Mark” or “Twain” or “Tom”. There’s a bronze statue of Tom Sawyer and Huck, another of Samuel Clemens, and a big billboard advertising admissions to Tom and Becky’s cave. Downtown there’s a Mark Train Museum, which we did not pay the 9 (or was it 14?) dollars a head to enter, and Mark Twain’s Boyhood Home. We didn’t locate Twain’s home even though it would have been easy enough to do. The heat must have got to us.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seems that the town is not typically awash in tourists, as the place is off the beaten track. I take the locals’ very congenial attitude toward tourists as evidence for this supposition. We were given accurate directions politely, and the good old boys sitting on a park bench shot a good-natured question or two about Magic. “Ya gotta black bear there, Ma’am?” “No, she’s a beast of burden”. Smiles and nods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bob, the pups and I strolled down to the river park, where there’s some simple landscaping, a fountain and a bronze of Samuel Clemens as a young river pilot. From the park you can look upriver to the steel highway bridge and beyond to the distant bend where muddy water disappears. Near where the bridge joins the shore, a substantial wooded bluff overlooks the river. Close to the park, moored at a small wharf is The Mark Twain Riverboat. A schedule boasts four river tours daily. Downstream, beyond the wharf, the Mississippi’s muddy water seems to widen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We drove into Omaha during evening rush hour. Bob was leading the way and we got separated in the heavy traffic. I thought I had my eye on his car up ahead but at a fork in the highway, he traveled left, I turned right. Oops. Unfortunately, at that point I didn’t know the precise location of the hotel... After a stop to get directions from locals, and a phone conversation with Bob (how did we cope before cell phones?) I got back on the road and finally arrived at the hotel just a few minutes behind the boys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Room service last night at our hotel. Bob enjoyed a steak and a couple of beers, Dan lasagna, the dogs split a plain burger and I had a salad. Then came the hard part: trying to sleep. Our neighbors were boisterous, the air conditioning wasn’t powerful enough to deal with the high humidity. College baseball world series was going on with apparently lots of the players staying at our hotel. (No ice in the ice machine this morning; the kids emptied it filling their coolers.) I slept very little; Bob, Dan and dogs were all good to go this morning.</description>
