    <richText>&lt;b&gt;Friday found us stopping in Hannibal, Missouri, boyhood home of Mark Twain. The Quality Inn was a fine stop. The room was large and cold (it had been a very hot day, so the blast of air-conditioned cold was a welcomed relief).&#xD;&#xD;Since Daniel is not a great traveler and prefers not to sight-see, our time in historic downtown Hannibal was brief. It&#x2019;s a quaint little town, filled with antique shops and it sita at the edge of the Mississippi River.&#xD;&#xD;The photo above is a dogs-eye view of a beautiful building on Main Street.&#xD;&#xD;Our next stop is set for Omaha, Nebraska, home of Warren Buffet (though, I doubt we&#x2019;ll spot him).&#xD;&#xD;So far, we&#x2019;re all holding up well. I&#x2019;m glad we decided to do about 300 miles a day. That&#x2019;s long enough with the 2 cars and the dog stops.&lt;/b&gt;</richText>
